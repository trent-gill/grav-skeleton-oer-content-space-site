I don't know have much of a background in coding, but I've been itching to learn how to use GitHub because it embodies almost all the features I value about the open web.

If you've heard of GitHub, you probably associate it with open source software. It's true that most of the projects hosted on GitHub in repositories are made up of code, and most of the workflows are optimized for programmers. 

However, GitHub is well equipped to deal with text files and Markdown, a flexible file format used to write for the web. As an open and collaborative platform that also deals with text files, GitHub provides an ideal system for authors (and educators) to share, collaborate, and maintain their content in the open. GitHub takes "working in the open" to the next level.

So, I've followed Paul Hibbitts' tutorial about setting up a basic Grav site that supports syncing to a GitHub repository. Setting it up was a breeze, and I've even been updating the GitHub repository through Working Copy and 1Writer on the iPad. These excellent apps are well worth the investment and can be used to seamlessly write and publish content to both your website and its GitHub repository. 

Maintaining a blog or website through the iPad can be a pain. Outside of the WordPress app, there is a limited selection of applications for blogging on the iPad. 

However, there are several great Markdown editors for editing text files, the most flexible format available for web writing. Most popular blogging platforms now support Markdown, including WordPress, Grav, Ghost, and Jekyll.

Of these four content management systems, I'm familiar enough with WordPress, Grav, and Ghost to muse about how to adapt a writing workflow to each platform.
