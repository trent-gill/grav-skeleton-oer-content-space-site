## Week 9: Peer Review Workshop

No pre-class readings this week. Please use the time to prepare a draft of your argumentative essay, whose instructions are available [here](/assignments). During your writing process, you should refer to the [summary of skills](/skills) for reminders on elements of critical essays. 

After a close overview of a sample argumentative essay, you'll break into groups to share your work and review the work of others. Please use the suggestions in the class slides when reviewing your own draft before submission.
