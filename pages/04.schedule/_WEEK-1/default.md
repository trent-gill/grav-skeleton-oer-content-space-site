**Week 1: Introduction to UW 30:151**

In our first class of the semester, we will go over the [course syllabus](/syllabus) and discuss its learning objectives.

The [handout](/skills) we will review summarizes what skills you need to succeed in this course. I emphasize the importance of this summary because knowing and developing these skills will help you write at the university level.

Students will also learn what to expect from the course, how it is organized, and how their work will be assessed. 

The course begins with a bird's eye view of academic writing as a means of sharing ideas, knowledge, and research. It is the main vehicle for what you'll come to know as the "scholarly conversation," which happens in a broader public context.

We start with a premise for this course and its overarching objective: to understand the relationship between the quality of your ideas and how you express them. 

At the end of the class, I'll ask you to complete a casual "assignment" to introduce yourself and to reflect upon the role of a university education in your life. More details can be found in the slides. I'll also direct you to the course website, where you can find your pre-class readings under [Week 2](/schedule) in the schedule.
