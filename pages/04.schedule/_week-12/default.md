## Week 12: Grammar Review

This class reviews all of the grammar topics we've discussed throughout the semester. Our review includes an extensive preview of how the grammar test is structured, with specific examples and terms you need to know to do well on it. Students should be prepared to discuss the elements of composition and grammatical concepts we've learned throughout the course.
