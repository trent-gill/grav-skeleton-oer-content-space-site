**Lecture**

Our discussions this week will be informed by questions and concerns surrounding academic integrity. We will also discuss writing techniques that demonstrate reading comprehension: summary, paraphrase, and quotation.

Academic integrity is a core value that governs how educators and students study, write, and conduct themselves both within and outside of education. Primarily, it is the guiding principle that demands we are honest and fair in our work. 

In education, work exists in the form of learning, which involves studying, researching, and writing. "Plagiarism" is how we refer to violations of academic integrity in research and in writing, and naturally it will occupy much of our focus for this class. Plagiarism is the use of others' work without attribution. It is the presentation of others' ideas as your own.

We will examine intentional and unintentional plagiarism and a variety of examples of each, and our focus will move to avoiding plagiarism through intuitive and attentive strategies and practices. These discussions will stress the profound importance of academic integrity and its relevance to our identity as students and educators. 

The strategies and practices to avoid plagiarism include purposeful use of summaries, paraphrases, and quotations, three methods writers use to present the knowledge and ideas of others. These skills allow writers to fluently integrate arguments, opinions, and facts into their own work while giving credit to the original author. 

By the end of this class, you will be able to distinguish between summary, paraphrase, and quotation. You will also know _when _each method should be used in your own essay and _how_ to effectively use them. You will also be well-equipped to avoid all forms of plagiarism whenever you integrate or rely on sources in your writing.
