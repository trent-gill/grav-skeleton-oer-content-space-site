**WEEK 6: Mid-Term Test on Summary, Paraphrase, and Academic Integrity**  

No pre-class readings for this week. You'll complete a short mid-term test worth 15% that will assess the modes of restatement we've discussed in class -- summary, paraphrase, and quotation. Please review the slides from the previous weeks so you have a solid foundation and ensure that you closely study the readings from week 3. To prepare for this test, you must be able to differentiate between the three methods, and you must be able to distinguish them as a whole from other writing tasks that are expected at the university level. You should also have a firm grasp on how to prevent plagiarism when integrating evidence.
