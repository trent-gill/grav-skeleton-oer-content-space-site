**Lecture**

Our discussion on critical reading expands on our topics from week 3. We take a deeper look at the methods and strategies writers use to get more out of a text. Summarizing, paraphrasing, and quoting are used to present information in a new context, but critical reading is how we make sense of attitudes, ideologies, and patterns of thought in a complex work. We'll discuss Tom Chatfield's "I type therefore I am" and show how close reading leads to exposition, two essential tools for reading and writing in an academic context. 

Please print out and bring copies of "I type therefore I am" and the [assignment instructions](/assignments) for your first essay. We'll discuss how essay prompts and questions are drawn from a primary text. To participate in this discussion it is essential to have these documents on hand. 

We'll also talk about paragraphs, a topic that serves as an introduction to the structure of academic essays. We'll define the paragraph as a microcosm of the whole essay by talking about topic sentences and how to support them. We'll also emphasize two features of effective paragraphs that help us think about effective structure more generally: coherence and unity. 

These topics will span two weeks. The class on February 2nd will be a more extensive discussion on paragraphs as the building blocks for the academic essay.
