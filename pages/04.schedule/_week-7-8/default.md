The next two weeks we'll be focusing on thesis statements, essay structure, and effective argumentation. We'll discuss how to write and revise thesis statements that are qualified, argumentative claims that assert the crux of the essay and provide guidance for your reader. We'll examine and compare a few examples of strong and weak thesis statements. 

Expanding on our discussion of thesis statements, we'll also discuss the structure of an academic essay more broadly. We'll develop a conceptual understanding of introductions and conclusions to understand their specific purposes. To this end, we'll discuss how they serve as "transition points" for your audience, and we'll go over different strategies and techniques writers use to write effective introductions and conclusions. 

We'll also return to body paragraphs in order to understand how they can be integrated well into an effective argument. You'll learn how each body paragraph serves to support, expand upon, and validate your essay's central claim. You'll also learn how ideas are organized, expressed, and supported by the logical connections your paragraphs make between generalized claims and specific evidence and examples. 

In addition to your textbook, there are many resources available online that cover and expand on these topics. I've identified a few of them above, but I welcome you to share resources you find useful on our Slack channel.
